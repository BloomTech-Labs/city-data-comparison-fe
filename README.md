# City Data Comparison - Working Title - citrics.io

This app democratizes access to information about cities. Any user can log on and instantly begin browsing friendly, accessible statistics  that give a general overview of US cities.

## Implementation

Citrics uses a proprietary data set from our data science team derived primarily from US census information. 

Cities with data are marked on a searchable, indexed map generated from the Mapbox.com API. Selected markers populate navigable data graphs powered by the Chartjs library that indicate important information about the selected city. Graphs are generated dynamically as users adjust their selection of cities to compare.

### Roadmap

Future features: 
- User account creation 
    - Quiz users to indicate their priorities in a city. This will power DS prediciton engine
    - Allow users to save records of which cities important to them
- Expanded data set - Pending DS completion, this app aims to encompass data from ~30000 US cities
- User-friendly API access to DS model via multiple endpoints (Premium feature)
