# City Data Comparison - Working Title - citrics.io

This app democratizes access to information about cities. Any user can log on and instantly begin browsing friendly, accessible statistics  that give a general overview of US cities.

## Implementation

Citrics uses a proprietary data set from our data science team derived primarily from US census information. Cities with data are marked on a map generated from the Mapbox.com API. Selected markers populate navigable data graphs powered by the Chartjs library that indicate important information about the selected city.

### Roadmap

Future features: 
- User account creation 
    - Quiz users to indicate their priorities in a city. This will power DS prediciton engine
    - Allow users to save records of which cities important to them
- Expanded data set - Pending DS completion, this app aims to encompass data from ~30000 US cities
- User-friendly API access to DS model via multiple endpoints (Premium feature)
