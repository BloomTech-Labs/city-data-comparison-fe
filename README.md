## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/VXbaBrSL/labs-19-citydatacomparison)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/City-Data-Comparison-bc94a2f56b05482e9c42a12748a0ed0a)

[UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/mkHP2saWvSK02a9g1cHoCM/City-Data-Comparison-Ruth-Philips?node-id=275%3A84)

Citrics is an application that analyzes data from cities such as populations, cost of living, crime rates and many other social and economic factors that are important in deciding where someone would like to live. Citrics present such important data in an intuitive and easy to understand interface.
<br>
Cities with data are marked on a searchable, indexed map generated from the Mapbox.com API. Selected markers populate navigable data graphs powered by the Chartjs library that indicate important information about the selected city. Graphs are generated dynamically as users adjust their selection of cities to compare.


### 4️⃣ Key Features

### Basic Features
- Allows users to search city data set without logging in
- Data visualization of city metrics 
- Map visualization that allows users to navigate and browse cities 
- Autofill search feature to streamline city searching 
- Specific city metrics accessible through side navigation 

### Future Features
- User account creation 
    - Quiz users to indicate their priorities in a city. This will power DS prediciton engine
    - Allow users to save records of which cities important to them
- Expanded data set - Pending DS completion, this app aims to encompass data from ~30000 US cities
- User-friendly API access to DS model via multiple endpoints (Premium feature)
